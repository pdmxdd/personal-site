## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### LaunchCode

All titles in reverse chronological order.

#### Director of Technical Training

Work with LaunchCode partnered companies to assess technical needs and design/build/teach curriculum to up-skill current partnered company employees.

##### Major Projects

[GIS DevOps](https://education.launchcode.org/gis-devops/): 13 week full-time program introducing DevOps and various GIS tooling. Program designed and run for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. I also served as the instructor for 5 of the 7 cohorts personally teaching over 50 students. The course covers basics of web development in Java/Spring, HTML/CSS and JS, NPM, OpenLayers, RESTful API design, unit testing, integration testing, TDD, Elasticsearch, Swagger, code linting, 12 Factor Apps, basic cloud deployments using AWS, Gradle, CI/CD with Jenkins, Docker, specific GIS tools, and more. It's just a massive class that covers tons of topics and is focused on building projects using the tools mentioned. 

[Microsoft Azure](https://education.launchcode.org/azure/): 3 week full-time program introducing REST, Bash & Powershell scripting, introduces various Azure cloud services, and basic ops-level troubleshooting. Program designed for Microsoft to introduce new hires to necessary tools to be used in their roles as SREs.

CodeCamp Instructor: Taught the pre-existing [Introduction to Web Development](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/) & [Java Web Development](https://education.launchcode.org/java-web-development/) courses over 15 weeks full-time. All 31 students passed the course and were able to effectively work as entry level developers. Program was performed for Comcast in an opportunity to up-skill Comcast employees that had served as Service Technicians, or in Customer Service. In addition to student success, I also managed 3 Teaching Assistants to reach the large number of students effectively.

#### Education Program Developer

Work as a general member of the Education team to create high quality curriculum to meet the needs of LaunchCode general learners.

##### Major Projects

[Liftoff](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/): Designed, built and taught an 8 week part-time program preparing students for technical interviews and strategies for continuing their technical education to better prepare for tech jobs. Program was built for graduates of the general LaunchCode Education programs as a way to bridge the gap between course end and starting a job in tech. The program has been incorporated into the standard process for general LaunchCode Education programs.

#### Candidate Engagement Manager

Evaluate and coach potential LaunchCode apprenticeship candidates and manage ongoing general education programs. I was the *first* person hired into this role and established the mold for the position.

- Conducted over 1000 LaunchCode candidate interviews to determine candidate readiness for an apprenticeship at LaunchCode partner companies.
- Redesigned candidate evaluation including interview script and new tech screen questions.
- Established the process of candidate coaching, eventually resulting in the Liftoff program listed above.
- LC101 Instructor: 20 week part-time introduction to programming curriculum similar to the CodeCamp program listed above. However, the older LC101 curriculum taught Python/Flask instead of JavaScript as the introductory language.

## EDUCATION

### University of Missouri St. Louis - B.A. Psychology 2015

I thoroughly enjoyed my time at UMSL. Originally my goal of going back to school after working as a programmer was twofold - *to complete a bachelor's degree* and to *build knowledge/skills around successfully performing interviews*.

At the time my career aspirations were to combine my technical skills with my soft skills to work towards a solution many companies face **evaluating and hiring tech talent**. At the time my dream job was to work as a technical interviewer. Someone that could combine technical knowledge and skills with human resource knowledge and skills to more effectively evaluate candidates for technical positions. I was able to work towards a realization of this goal in my time at LaunchCode.

{{% expand "I was able to work directly towards my aspiration throughout my tenure at LaunchCode. Click here to expand/collapse the story of my transition from UMSL to LaunchCode." %}}

During my final semester at UMSL I became aware of a local startup non-profit called LaunchCode that seemed to be working in a similar space to my current aspirations. I applied for their program to be a candidate. If I passed the application and evaluation they could place me into a programming apprenticeship. I assumed LaunchCode might be able to adequately connect me with companies that would provide me the opportunity to continue growing my technical skills and/or let me start working in technical evaluations.

LaunchCode advanced my application to their program and invited me to interview to evaluate if I would be a good candidate for their apprenticeship program. I passed their evaluation and was approved to be a part of their program and then the interviewer asked me what my ideal job would be, and shared with him my aspirations as listed above.

He chuckled and remarked that I was looking for a job that is similar to what he is currently doing. I told him I did not know that LaunchCode may be interested in someone with my skill-set and remarked that "Yes, I am very interested in a job that would be performing similar evaluations to the one we just completed.".

A couple of weeks pass, I graduate from UMSL, and I get an email from the individual that completed my LaunchCode evaluation stating that LaunchCode had just opened a new position and he thought I might be a good fit. I applied, interviewed, and landed the job. That's where my professional relationship with LaunchCode began and I am happy to say I have grown as an individual and professional. I was able to work on my original aspiration of **evaluating and hiring tech talent** directly and was able to create the guide for new Candidate Engagement Managers. I eventually advanced into working on entirely new problems for LaunchCode!

### Linn State Technical College - A.A.S Computer Programming 2011

Linn State is where I originally began my formal education in tech. I had a smattering of classes on programming and I learned a lot. However, I would say what I learned at LSTC has been far eclipsed in my time working as a professional programmer and in my time at LaunchCode.

School name changed to State Technical College of Missouri in 2014.

## CODING PROJECTS

### Personal Website 

*This* website! It will eventually become a place I can share personal projects that are not related to my professional dealings. For now it holds my resume and ways to get in touch with me. I look forward to updating this site with additional projects as I am constantly progressing with my own learning journey!

#### Links

- [Github repo](https://github.com/pdmxdd/personal-site)

#### Technologies

- Hugo
  - markdown
  - small amount of Go & Go templates
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript
- Caddy
- DigitalOcean


### GIS DevOps Final Project

The project took various forms through the evolution of the program. The majority of the graduates built a version of the project using MVC (Zika Spring MVC). In the final cohort my co-instructor and I adapted the project to be discrete front end (Zika Client) and back end (Mapnotes API) projects while adding functionality.

### Expense Tracker

A project I put together after designing and building Liftoff. The project was intended to serve as a guide for Liftoff students as they begin working on their own personal projects. I chose a tech stack I had little experience with and built a project similar in nature to what graduates are expected to build. My colleague and partner on the Liftoff program also built a project. We documented our journeys as a guide for students.

## DREAM JOB

I have an interest in many jobs related to technology and technical education. However, I am currently fascinated by a unique combination of my skills.

In combining my technical skills (coding/Devops), with curriculum development, and teaching I can offer a unique service in the form of a **teaching technologist**.

{{% expand "Click here to see my ideas around the role and benefits of a teaching technologist" %}}

I would spend 75% of my time as a normal member of the tech team, and 25% of my time documenting my work around the problems I have solved. This would result in curriculum that would capture the process of solving problems as a programmer or DevOps professional. 

This curriculum would have a large number of benefits. I see it being especially valuable to recent hires early in their careers to see and actively work through solutions to various problems. The curriculum also serving as additional documentation that provides the *context* around the problem solving process serving as a powerful tool for sharing domain knowledge.

I envision a basic framework for the task post-mortem I would write:

- task breakdown
  - what problem will the work solve?
- problem research
  - how was the problem identified
  - who is affected by the problem
  - potential solution research
    - has this problem been encountered before
      - by members of the team
      - by members of the company
      - by individuals on the internet
    - do any pre-built solutions currently exist
    - what is would need to happen for a solution to be developed in house
- solution selection decision
  - viability of solution
  - ease of implementation
  - cost to company
  - solution ability to be maintained
- solution implementation
  - what tests were written and why
    - how do the tests prove the problem has been resolved
  - necessary refactor?
    - code quality
      - best practices
    - code optimization
      - big O notation
- code review
  - what issues were identified
  - was a refactor necessary after 
    - if so how was the refactor tested and implemented
    - did the changes pass the review?
- integration of code into master/main/production branch
  - merge strategy
- deployment process
  - on release schedule or immediate
  - automated or manual
    - CI/CD mechanisms of automated deployment

The framework would certainly evolve as I grow into the role and learn the most effective pieces of data to collect and work into the written journey of problem solving.

### Benefits to Company

I see this work as highly beneficial to companies with technical teams.

Assuming the post-mortem is privately hosted benefits include:

- learning opportunity for entire tech team
- preserve often forgotten context surrounding problems and chosen solutions
  - essentially offloading domain knowledge from specific individuals to a permanent repository controlled by the company
- fantastic onboarding materials for new hires
  - specific examples of previous work that has been performed
  - provided framework for the process of contributing successfully
- provide insight into the process of tech work to non technical individuals

Additional benefits of the post-mortem being publicly hosted:

- provide transparency to potential technical hires
- provide guidance to currently learning individuals
  - additional benefit of creating potential future hires
- can be marketed

### Benefits to Me

More than anything this type of role would allow me to continue growing technically. In my time at LaunchCode my tech skills have grown by leaps and bounds, but the majority of the coding projects I create are of the educational nature. I have a strong desire to directly contribute to a tech team.

In addition I would get to utilize my many educational skills designing, writing, mentoring and teaching. Being able to continue using both of these skill-sets professionally will give me a **sense of happiness** in my work.

Finally, being able to share my journey with others, especially to learners early in their journey's through tech, will give me a **sense of fulfillment** in my work.

**If this type of work seems attractive to your company do not hesitate in [reaching out to me](mailto:paul@paulmatthews.dev). I would be very interested in discussing how this idea could be adapted into reality.**
