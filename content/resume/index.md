## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### LaunchCode

All my titles in reverse chronological order.

#### Director of Technical Training

Work with LaunchCode partnered companies to assess technical needs and design/build/teach curriculum to up-skill current partnered company employees.

##### Major Projects

[GIS DevOps](https://education.launchcode.org/gis-devops/): 13 week full-time program introducing DevOps and various GIS tooling. Program designed and run for a specific U.S. federal agency and member of the U.S. intelligence community (happy to provide details in interview). I also served as the instructor for 5 of the 7 cohorts personally teaching over 50 students. The course covers basics of web development in Java/Spring, HTML/CSS and JS, NPM, OpenLayers, RESTful API design, unit testing, integration testing, TDD, Elasticsearch, Swagger, code linting, 12 Factor Apps, basic cloud deployments using AWS, Gradle, CI/CD with Jenkins, Docker, specific GIS tools, and more. It's just a massive class that covers tons of topics and is focused on building projects using the tools mentioned. It is currently a dead project as the U.S. agency successfully up-skilled the number of employees they originally needed.

[Microsoft Azure](https://education.launchcode.org/azure/): 3 week full-time program introducing REST, Bash & Powershell scripting, introduces various Azure cloud services, and basic ops-level troubleshooting. Program designed for Microsoft to introduce new hires to necessary tools to be used in their roles as SREs.

CodeCamp Instructor: Taught the pre-existing [Introduction to Web Development](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/) & [Java Web Development](https://education.launchcode.org/java-web-development/) courses over 15 weeks full-time. All 31 students passed the course and were able to effectively work as entry level developers. Program was performed for Comcast in an opportunity to up-skill Comcast employees that had served as Service Technicians, or in Customer Service. In addition to student success, I also managed 3 Teaching Assistants to reach the large number of students effectively.

#### Education Program Developer

##### Major Projects

[Liftoff](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/): Designed, built and taught an 8 week part-time program preparing students for technical interviews and strategies for continuing their technical education to better prepare for tech jobs. Program was built for graduates of the general LaunchCode Education programs as a way to bridge the gap between course end and starting a job in tech. The program has been incorporated into the standard process for general LaunchCode Education programs.

#### Candidate Engagement Manager

- Conducted over 1000 LaunchCode candidate interviews to determine candidate readiness for an apprenticeship at LaunchCode partner companies.
- Redesigned candidate evaluation including interview script and new tech screen questions.
- Established the process of candidate coaching, eventually resulting in the Liftoff program listed above.
- LC101 Instructor: 20 week part-time introduction to programming curriculum similar to the CodeCamp program listed above. However, the older LC101 curriculum taught Python/Flask instead of JavaScript as the introductory language.
