## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### LaunchCode

All my titles in reverse chronological order.

#### Director of Technical Training

Work with LaunchCode partnered companies to assess technical needs and design/build/teach curriculum to up-skill current partnered company employees.

##### Major Projects

[GIS DevOps](https://education.launchcode.org/gis-devops/): 13 week full-time program introducing DevOps and various GIS tooling. Program designed and run for a specific U.S. federal agency and member of the U.S. intelligence community (happy to provide details in interview). I also served as the instructor for 5 of the 7 cohorts personally teaching over 50 students. The course covers basics of web development in Java/Spring, HTML/CSS and JS, NPM, OpenLayers, RESTful API design, unit testing, integration testing, TDD, Elasticsearch, Swagger, code linting, 12 Factor Apps, basic cloud deployments using AWS, Gradle, CI/CD with Jenkins, Docker, specific GIS tools, and more. It's just a massive class that covers tons of topics and is focused on building projects using the tools mentioned. It is currently a dead project as the U.S. agency successfully up-skilled the number of employees they originally needed.

[Microsoft Azure](https://education.launchcode.org/azure/): 3 week full-time program introducing REST, Bash & Powershell scripting, introduces various Azure cloud services, and basic ops-level troubleshooting. Program designed for Microsoft to introduce new hires to necessary tools to be used in their roles as SREs.

CodeCamp Instructor: Taught the pre-existing [Introduction to Web Development](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/) & [Java Web Development](https://education.launchcode.org/java-web-development/) courses over 15 weeks full-time. All 31 students passed the course and were able to effectively work as entry level developers. Program was performed for Comcast in an opportunity to up-skill Comcast employees that had served as Service Technicians, or in Customer Service. In addition to student success, I also managed 3 Teaching Assistants to reach the large number of students effectively.

#### Education Program Developer

##### Major Projects

[Liftoff](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/): Designed, built and taught an 8 week part-time program preparing students for technical interviews and strategies for continuing their technical education to better prepare for tech jobs. Program was built for graduates of the general LaunchCode Education programs as a way to bridge the gap between course end and starting a job in tech. The program has been incorporated into the standard process for general LaunchCode Education programs.

#### Candidate Engagement Manager

- Conducted over 1000 LaunchCode candidate interviews to determine candidate readiness for an apprenticeship at LaunchCode partner companies.
- Redesigned candidate evaluation including interview script and new tech screen questions.
- Established the process of candidate coaching, eventually resulting in the Liftoff program listed above.
- LC101 Instructor: 20 week part-time introduction to programming curriculum similar to the CodeCamp program listed above. However, the older LC101 curriculum taught Python/Flask instead of JavaScript as the introductory language.

## EDUCATION

### University of Missouri St. Louis - B.A. Psychology 2015

I thoroughly enjoyed my time at UMSL. Originally my goal of going back to school after working as a programmer was two fold *to complete a bachelor's degree* and to *build knowledge/skills around successfully performing interviews*.

At the time my career aspirations were to combine my technical skills with my soft skills to work towards a solution many companies face **evaluating and hiring tech talent**. At the time my dream job was to work as a technical interviewer. Someone that could combine technical knowledge and skills with human resource knowledge and skills to more effectively evaluate candidates for technical positions. I was able to work towards a solution to this goal in my time at LaunchCode.

{{% expand "I was able to work directly towards my aspiration throughout my tenure at LaunchCode. Click here to expand/collapse the story of my transition from UMSL to LaunchCode." %}}

During my final semester at UMSL I became aware of a local startup non-profit called LaunchCode that seemed to be working in a similar space to my current aspirations. I applied for their program to be a candidate. If I passed the application and evaluation they could place me into a programming apprenticeship. I assumed LaunchCode might be able to adequately connect me with companies that would provide me the opportunity to continue growing my technical skills and/or let me start working in technical evaluations.

LaunchCode advanced my application to their program and invited me to interview to evaluate if I would be a good candidate for their apprenticeship program. I passed their evaluation and was approved to be a part of their program and then the interviewer asked me what my ideal job would be, and shared with him my aspirations as listed above.

He chuckled and remarked that I was looking for a job that is similar to what he is currently doing. I told him I did not know that LaunchCode may be interested in someone with my skill-set and remarked that "Yes, I am very interested in a job that would be performing similar evaluations to the one we just completed.".

A couple of weeks pass, I graduate from UMSL, and I get an email from the individual that completed my LaunchCode evaluation stating that LaunchCode had just opened a new position and he thought I might be a good fit. I applied, interviewed, and landed the job. That's where my professional relationship with LaunchCode began and happy to say I have grown as an individual and professional. I was able to work on my original aspiration of **evaluating and hiring tech talent** directly and was able to create the guide for new Candidate Engagement Managers and advanced into working on entirely new problems for LaunchCode!

### Linn State Technical College - A.A.S Computer Programming 2011

Linn State is where I originally began my formal education in tech. I had a smattering of classes od programming and I learned a lot. However, I would say what I learned at LSTC has been far eclipsed in my time working as a professional programmer and in my time at LaunchCode.

School name changed to State Technical College of Missouri in 2014.

## DREAM JOB

I have an interest in many jobs related to technology and technical education. However, I am currently fascinated by a unique combination of my skills.

In combining my technical skills (coding/Devops), with curriculum development, and teaching I can offer a unique service in the form of what I call a **teaching technologist**.

{{% expand "Click here to see my ideas around the role and benefits of a teaching technologist" %}}

I would spend 50% (negotiable) of my time working as a normal member of the tech team. Completing tasks assigned to me by the team lead or product manager. Assuming all responsibilities of any other team member.

With the remaining 50% (negotiable) of my time I would document my journey in working through my sprint task(s) resulting in a written post-mortem of my work. 

These writing would be I would then share this journey with my colleagues. I would additionally use the writings as onboarding materials for new team members a responsibility I would be heavily involved with.

I envision a basic framework for the task post-mortem I would write:

- task breakdown
  - what problem will the work solve?
- problem research
  - how was the problem identified
  - who is affected by the problem
  - potential solution research
    - has this problem been encountered before
      - by members of the team
      - by members of the company
      - by individuals on the internet
    - do any pre-built solutions currently exist
    - what is would need to happen for a solution to be developed in house
- solution selection decision
  - viability of solution
  - ease of implementation
  - cost to company
  - solution ability to be maintained
- solution implementation
  - what tests were written and why
    - how do the tests prove the problem has been resolved
  - necessary refactor?
    - code quality
      - best practices
    - code optimization
      - big O notation
- code review
  - what issues were identified
  - was a refactor necessary after 
    - if so how was the refactor tested and implemented
    - did the changes pass the review?
- integration of code into master/main/production branch
  - merge strategy
- deployment process
  - on release schedule or immediate
  - automated or manual
    - CI/CD mechanisms of automated deployment

I'm sure the framework would evolve over iterations, but is the base I would start my curriculum development around.

### Benefits to Company

I see this work as highly beneficial to companies with technical teams.

Assuming the post-mortem is privately hosted:

- learning opportunity for entire tech team
- preserve often forgotten context surrounding problems and chosen solutions
  - essentially offloading domain knowledge from specific individuals to a permanent repository controlled by the company
- fantastic onboarding materials for new hires
  - specific examples of previous work that has been performed
  - provided framework for the process of contributing successfully
- provide insight to the process of tech work to non technical individuals

Additional benefits of the post-mortem being publicly hosted:

- provide transparency to potential technical hires
- provide guidance to currently learning individuals
  - additional benefit of creating potential future hires
- can be marketed

### Benefits to Me

I get to utilize many of the skills (programming, DevOps, writing, teaching, mentoring) I enjoy using professionally giving me a **sense of happiness** in my work.

If the post-mortems are public, I will get to continue inspiring learners in their journey's through tech, giving me a **sense of fulfillment** in my work. 

**If this type of work seems attractive to your company do not hesitate in [reaching out to me](mailto:paul@paulmatthews.dev). I would be very interested in discussing how this idea could be adapted into reality.**
